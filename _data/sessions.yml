  title: "Android L - Notifications"
  description: "In this talk I'm going to introduce the changes around notifications in Android L.<br>
<br>
Those changes start with a new design of notifications. Though some of those come automagically, you have to add information for other parts to get the best results.<br>
Another change coming is the ability to present notifications on the lock screen. Obviously not everything should be visible there. Let's see how to keep private stuff private while still making use of this feature.<br>
And finally there's the new ability to get the users immediate attention by using the new &quot;Heads-on notifications&quot;.<br>
<br>
All this is guided by my firm believe that notifications should inform users but not annoy them!"

  title: "Machine Learning - Creating smart apps for smart devices"
  description: "Artificial intelligence and automated learning is a scientific approach to turn computers into smart machines, being capable to use acquired knowledge to master tasks autonomously, thus without instruction or supervision. The fundamental laws of learning theory apply in the same way as for animals or humans, where thorough knowledge has been acquired and used in education for decades. Though still a lot of mathematical and statistical methods are widely used for data analysis and processing, the focus is shifting towards the aspects of perception, training and optimization. Knowledge extraction and representation becomes an evolutionary process, the concluded behavioural rules being developed by adapting and improving them continuously while being used. After giving birth to new intelligent computer species by programmed code, they need education before and during their professional career serving us, others or themselves. The technical art of coding is complemented by the task of how to properly feed and train our electronic kids."

  title: "Polymer.dart"
  description: "<p>Traditional HTML-Pages consist of a vast cascade of elements sharing the same CSS and DOM. With Polymer.dart you can encapsulate your elements by creating your own custom HTML-Tags that you can reuse everywhere without the hassle of adjusting the CSS each time. Polymer.dart can be used to create decent button-elements, forms or whole applications that can be added to every HTML-Page just by using a tag.</p>
                <p>Even if you don’t intend to create your own custom elements, Polymer already comes with a growing number of ready to use elements.</p>
                <p>Polymer come in two flavours Polymer which uses traditional technologies like CSS and Javascript. Polymer.dart makes use of the new features of dart. This talk will focus more on Polymer.dart. However the concepts are the same and it is easy to adopt them to Polymer. </p>"

  description: "Since its inception, Gradle has been causing some stir in the development community. Many big players in the industry have adopted it, and recently Google was one of them, choosing it as a build tool for Android.<br>
What is Gradle? What makes it different than the other build tools out there in the wild? Is it really so powerful? How can we benefit from it?<br>
Get a brief introduction to Gradle in a lightning talk, where I'll try to answer some of these questions.
<br>
In the workshop that follows, we'll go beyond - get our hands dirty, explore, hack and experiment.
Prepare your questions, bring your own code, and we'll look for solutions together. Most importantly - we'll have some fun."

In this session you’ll see how to use the Android Wear SDK to build a connected cloud-powered application. Using Android Studio and it’s cloud extensions, you’ll see how to build an app that ‘listens’ for changes in stock prices, and notifies a wearable device. You’ll also see how to use voice controls on the device to trigger interactions with the app, such as buying or selling the stock after a notification. Call to action: Get the SDK and start building apps today!"
