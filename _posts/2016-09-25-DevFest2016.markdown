The GDG Düsseldorf DevFest 2016 is coming up! 2014 we held a very
popular "DevFest", 2015 we took a break - and now it is 2016 and we
are back again!

Mark the dates! #GDGDus will host Devfest2016, a developer conference,
the weekend of October 22 and 23. Details will follow, however we
wanted to make sure everyone is aware and that everyone can block the
date. It will be possible to join for one or both days.
