Hello GDG’ers,

[+Frederik Schweiger](https://plus.google.com/105347649283366833102), our organizer of the month, has good news! We are proud to announce our next meetup on the 28th of April. Our annual April’s ‘Android Abend’ will take place for the first time - ever :smile:

We’ll have brilliant speakers with three awesome presentations waiting to be heard by you - the topics range from Android Auto Media over RxJava to improving your productivity using Trello.

The presentations: [+Wolfram Rittmeyer](https://plus.google.com/101948439228765005787) and [+Pascal Welsch](https://plus.google.com/108162731626734859070) will introduce you to the world of RxJava. [+Resul Kocyigit](https://plus.google.com/113156548068895538968) is going to make some noise - he introduces us to the media universe on Android Auto and, last but not least, [+Giulio Petek](https://plus.google.com/109582695389511977136) will take us on a ride through the world of MVVM and teach us how it can help you to improve your code's cleanness, maintainability and testability.

As usual, this event and the very delicious pizza will be sponsored by [Scaratec](https://it.scaratec.com/).

Hope to see you all there! April 28th, at 19 o’clock!
