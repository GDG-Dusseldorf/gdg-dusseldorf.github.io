				Google Developer Group (GDG) Duesseldorf is a free-form community of people, primarily developers, interested in Google's developer technology and Google´s philosophy: everything from the Android, Chrome, Drive, Analytics, Google Cloud platforms to APIs, Google glass, Google driveless car and much more.
                        </p><p>
The Meetups of GDG Duesseldorf take many forms — from a bunch of geeks chatting on some hot issues, to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to even larger events like hackathons. However, at the core, our events are focused on developers and technical content.
